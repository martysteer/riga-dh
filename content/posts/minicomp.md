### Minimal Computing Principles to Facilitate GBL

*by Amy Chen - 10 Oct 2019*

Although I did not know about minimal computing principles when I first set out to develop open educational resource (OER) card games back in 2016, I became enthusiastic when I discovered this movement in July 2019 because it advocates for approaches that make technology and, by proxy, game design more accessible. It isn’t about using the most expensive hardware (Kim Brillante Knight), undergoing extensive training (Anne McGrail), or having the flashiest website (see what I did there, Stewart Varner?). It’s about getting started with what you have, using what you know, and keeping it simple, stupid (KISS). It’s doing one thing and doing it well (DOTADIW). It’s focusing on user experience (UX). It’s getting things done (GTD). It’s probably other acronyms, too. I used all of this to help me be successful as a game designer without any experience in the field, or even much knowledge of the world of tabletop gaming. And now I want to explain how you can apply minimal computing approaches to game-based learning (GBL).
